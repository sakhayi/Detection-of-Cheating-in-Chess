# Detection of Cheating in Chess

## Summary
Building AI Course Project

## Background
In the last few years -as chess engines have become stronger than ever- we have sometimes witnessed chess players of all levels seeking silicon help to beat stronger opposition. Cheating in chess -and detection of it- turned into a more serious topic in September 2022 when world champion Magnus Carlsen withdrew from the Sinquefield Cup after losing against American GM Hans Niemann, silently accusing him of cheating (without providing any concrete evidence).
In this project, we are going to offer a new method for detection of cheating in chess games.
